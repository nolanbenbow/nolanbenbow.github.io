However, since the hiring of Matt Nagy there has been a decline in production, especially during the 2024 season. It makes one question, what was the real problem with the Chiefs? What led to the steep decline in production as compared to years past?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data =currentqbs ,\n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD, size=Int), alpha =0.3) +\n  scale_size(range=c(3,8), name = \"Interceptions\" \n  ) +\n   geom_point(\n    data = Hurts24,\n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD, size=Int), color = \"#004C54\")  +\n  geom_text(\n    data = Hurts24,\n    aes(x=PassingYds-255, y=TD, label = Player)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Mahomes24,\n    aes(x=PassingYds, y=TD, size=Int), color = \"#E31837\") +\n  geom_text(\n    data = Mahomes24,\n    aes(x=PassingYds+400, y=TD+.5, label = Player)) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 3693.13) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 25.30435) +\n theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Passing Yards\", y = \"Passing TDs\",\n    title = \"Mahomes' 2024 wasn't as bad as people think\",\n    subtitle = \"Even though it wasn't as productive as previous seasons, it was still above average\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 4200, y =44 ),\n    label = \"More yards, more TDs\",\n    size = 4, \n    color = \"#013369\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 3000, y =15 ),\n    label = \"Less yards, less TDs\",\n    size = 4, \n    color = \"#013369\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Look at Mahomes’ passing stats and there isn’t a clear and obvious answer. Many in the media would make it seem like Mahomes had an extremely bad year at quarterback. However when looking at where he ranks among quarterbacks who have started at least 12 games, he still is still above average. What’s more surprising is that he even out performed Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts this season in passing statistics.\nAnother argument that people bring up is that Mahomes’ offensive line was among the worst in the league.\n\n\nCode\nMahomesSackStats |&gt; \n   gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Season = \"Year\",\n    Sk = \"Times Sacked\",\n    SackYds = \"Sack Yards\",\n    SkPct= \"Sack Percentage\",\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title =  \"The Chiefs offensive line was the worst in the Mahomes era\",\n    subtitle = \"When comparing to previous seasons, Mahomes was sacked far more times in 2024 than any other season\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n    ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\")\n    ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E31837\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n     locations = cells_body(\n        rows = Season == \"2024\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chiefs offensive line was the worst in the Mahomes era\n\n\nWhen comparing to previous seasons, Mahomes was sacked far more times in 2024 than any other season\n\n\nYear\nTimes Sacked\nSack Yards\nSack Percentage\n\n\n\n\n2019\n17\n105.3\n3.39\n\n\n2020\n22\n108.2\n3.61\n\n\n2021\n28\n98.5\n4.08\n\n\n2022\n26\n105.2\n3.86\n\n\n2023\n27\n92.6\n4.33\n\n\n2024\n36\n93.5\n5.83\n\n\n\nSource: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface, it does seem like an extremely valid argument. Compared to every other season as the Chiefs starter, Mahomes took more sacks in 2024. Before the 2024 season, he had only been sacked a career high 28 times in 2021. But in 2024, he was sacked 36 times with a sack percentage of 5.83%.\nOn paper it looks bad but how does it stack up to the rest of the league this season?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data =currentqbs ,\n    aes(x=SackYds, y=Sk, size=SkPct), alpha =0.3) +\n  scale_size(range=c(3,8), name = \"Sack Percentage\" \n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Hurts24,\n    aes(x=SackYds, y=Sk, size=SkPct), color = \"#004C54\")  +\n  geom_text(\n    data = Hurts24,\n    aes(x=SackYds+4, y=Sk, label = Player)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Mahomes24,\n    aes(x=SackYds, y=Sk, size=SkPct), color = \"#E31837\")  +\n  geom_text(\n    data = Mahomes24,\n    aes(x=SackYds+6, y=Sk-1, label = Player)) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 96.59565 ) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 36.30435  ) +\n theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Yards Lost\", y = \"Sacks\",\n    title = \"Statisically, Mahomes faired better in the pocket than most\",\n    subtitle = \"Even though it was bad for Mahomes era standards, It was actually a little better than average\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 110, y =66 ),\n    label = \"More sacks, More yards lost\",\n    size = 4, \n    color = \"#013369\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 88, y =17 ),\n    label = \"Less sacks, less yards lost\",\n    size = 4, \n    color = \"#013369\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s interesting is that when compared to other quarterbacks who had started at least 12 games this past season, Mahomes’ offensive line actually held up better. In fact, Mahomes was sacked less than 11 other quarterbacks and lost less yards than 12 quarterbacks. So while yes, Mahomes was sacked more times than at any other point in his career, it wasn’t as bad as some would make you think.\nOne category that it could be is that the offense was not disciplined when on the field. The more penalties that are called, the more likely that an offense will stall out.\n\n\nCode\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=offensestats24, aes(reorder(Tm, Penalties), weight=Penalties), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=ChiefsOffense24, aes(reorder(Tm, Penalties), weight=Penalties), fill=\"#E31837\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total Penalties\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=offensestats24, aes(reorder(Tm, PenaltyYards), weight=PenaltyYards), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=ChiefsOffense24, aes(reorder(Tm, PenaltyYards), weight=PenaltyYards), fill=\"#E31837\") +\n  coord_flip()+  \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total Penalty Yards\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar1 + bar2 + \nplot_annotation(\n    title = \"Kansas City was one of the most disciplined teams on offense\",\n    subtitle = \"The Chiefs ranked 29th in penalties commited and 22nd in penalty yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pre Football Reference | By Nolan Benbow\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in all actuality, the Chiefs offense was one of the least penalized units in the league. While fans may cry that the referees are on Kansas City’s side, the statistics seem to potentially give that claim some credibility, at the end of the day, penalties were one area that Kansas City thrived in. They never really put themselves in poor situations because they kept committing penalties.\nLastly, how does the Chiefs rushing offense look compared to the rest of the league?\n\n\nCode\nrushingstats |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Tm = \"Team\",\n    RushingAtt = \"Rushing Attempts\",\n    RushingYds = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    RushingTD = \"Rushing  Touchdowns\",\n    RushingYardsPerAttempt = \"Rushing Yards Per Attempt\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title =  \"The Chiefs rushing production is severely lacking\",\n    subtitle = \"While not the worst by any means, Kansas City's rushing attack seems to be an after thought\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n    ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\")\n    ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E31837\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n     locations = cells_body(\n        rows = Tm == \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#004C54\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n     locations = cells_body(\n        rows = Tm == \"Philadelphia Eagles\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chiefs rushing production is severely lacking\n\n\nWhile not the worst by any means, Kansas City's rushing attack seems to be an after thought\n\n\nSeason\nTeam\nRushing Attempts\nRushing Yards\nRushing Touchdowns\nRushing Yards Per Attempt\n\n\n\n\n2024\nBaltimore Ravens\n554\n3189\n21\n5.8\n\n\n2024\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n621\n3048\n29\n4.9\n\n\n2024\nWashington Commanders\n526\n2619\n25\n5.0\n\n\n2024\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n483\n2536\n16\n5.3\n\n\n2024\nGreen Bay Packers\n526\n2496\n23\n4.7\n\n\n2024\nDetroit Lions\n534\n2488\n29\n4.7\n\n\n2024\nArizona Cardinals\n463\n2451\n18\n5.3\n\n\n2024\nIndianapolis Colts\n496\n2331\n20\n4.7\n\n\n2024\nBuffalo Bills\n491\n2230\n32\n4.5\n\n\n2024\nAtlanta Falcons\n495\n2219\n18\n4.5\n\n\n2024\nPittsburgh Steelers\n533\n2166\n14\n4.1\n\n\n2024\nSan Francisco 49ers\n457\n2163\n17\n4.7\n\n\n2024\nNew England Patriots\n446\n1969\n11\n4.4\n\n\n2024\nNew Orleans Saints\n444\n1954\n15\n4.4\n\n\n2024\nHouston Texans\n434\n1909\n15\n4.4\n\n\n2024\nDenver Broncos\n461\n1908\n12\n4.1\n\n\n2024\nLos Angeles Chargers\n463\n1882\n17\n4.1\n\n\n2024\nCarolina Panthers\n410\n1878\n18\n4.6\n\n\n2024\nMinnesota Vikings\n457\n1855\n9\n4.1\n\n\n2024\nTennessee Titans\n450\n1855\n11\n4.1\n\n\n2024\nMiami Dolphins\n448\n1795\n12\n4.0\n\n\n2024\nKansas City Chiefs\n450\n1790\n15\n4.0\n\n\n2024\nNew York Giants\n424\n1783\n13\n4.2\n\n\n2024\nLos Angeles Rams\n450\n1765\n15\n3.9\n\n\n2024\nChicago Bears\n431\n1734\n13\n4.0\n\n\n2024\nJacksonville Jaguars\n414\n1729\n13\n4.2\n\n\n2024\nDallas Cowboys\n429\n1705\n6\n4.0\n\n\n2024\nSeattle Seahawks\n383\n1627\n17\n4.2\n\n\n2024\nCleveland Browns\n391\n1608\n8\n4.1\n\n\n2024\nCincinnati Bengals\n380\n1574\n11\n4.1\n\n\n2024\nNew York Jets\n363\n1561\n8\n4.3\n\n\n2024\nLas Vegas Raiders\n380\n1357\n10\n3.6\n\n\n\nSource: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results actually could actually lead to the answer. Kansas City Ranked 22nd in the league in rushing yards this season with only 1,790 yards. To put that in context, 12 of 14 teams who made the playoffs rank higher than KC with seven of them being in the top ten. Some of this could be attributed to the fact that Kansas City lost starting running back Isiah Pacheco early in the season with a fractured fibula. However, that still shouldn’t lead to such a lack of production. The fact of the matter is that the chiefs could never get the run game going all season long.\nWhen one takes all of these factors into account, it would seem like there are two likely reasons to explain why the Chiefs offense struggled this year. The first argument being that It wasn’t as bad as people think, but that Chiefs fans and the NFL have been spoiled by Mahomes and the Chiefs high flying offense since 2019. However the more likely cause is the lack of a run game. Without a run game, it forces Mahomes to try and do too much, which would lead to more sacks and an overall lack of production from the offense."

    "text": "Since 2019, The Kansas City Chiefs have dominated the NFL. In that time, Mahomes and the Chiefs have been to every AFC Championship game and have been in five of six Super Bowls. Out of all the teams that the Chiefs have played in the Super Bowl, only two have managed to beat them.\nAt this time, the only starting quarterback to beat Kansas City in the Super Bowl has been Jalen Hurts. The Eagles have made the Super Bowl twice since 2019 and have faced the Chiefs both times. The Eagles Just barely lost to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII on what was a controversial holding call. However this past season in Super Bowl LIX, Philadelphia blew the doors off of Kansas City winning 40-22.\nThis poses the question, are the Eagles the most likely to overtake the Chiefs as a dynasty?\nFirst, let’s take a glance at their stats since Jalen Hurts became the starting quarterback in 2020 and compare them to Kansas City.\nThe first question is how has each team’s offense ranked over the last five seasons?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nTeamOffense &lt;- read_csv(\"nfl_team_offense_2020_2024.csv\")\nQBs &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs19752024.csv\")\ntopoffenses &lt;- read_csv(\"nfl_team_offense_2020_2024.csv\")\nTotalOffense &lt;- read_csv(\"nfl_team_offense_2020_2024.csv\")\nTeamDefense &lt;- read_csv(\"nfl_team_defense_2020_2024.csv\")\n\nTotalOffense24 &lt;- TotalOffense |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2024\") \n\nEagles24 &lt;- TotalOffense24 |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2024\", Tm == \"Philadelphia Eagles\")\n\nTopOffenses24 &lt;- topoffenses |&gt; \n  group_by(Tm, Season) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    RushYds = mean(RushingYds),\n    PassYds = mean(PassingYds),\n    TotalYds = RushYds + PassYds,\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2024\")\n\nTopOffenses24Long &lt;- TopOffenses24|&gt; \n  select(-TotalYds) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"Yds\"),\n    names_to = \"Type\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \ngeom_bump(data=TeamOffense, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm)) +\n geom_point(data=TeamOffense, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm), size = 5) +\n  geom_text(data = TeamOffense |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x = Season - .2, y=Rk, label = Tm), size = 3.5, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = TeamOffense |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x = Season + .2, y=Rk, label = Tm), size = 3.5, hjust = 0) +\n   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024), limits = c(2018, 2026)) + \n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n  \"Kansas City Chiefs\" = \"#E31837\",\n  \"Philadelphia Eagles\" = \"#4CBB17\",\n  \"other\" = \"grey\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Eagles offense remains one of the NFL's best\",\n    subtitle=\"Since Super Bowl LVII, &lt;span style = 'color:#4CBB17;'&gt;Philadelphia's'&lt;/span&gt; offense still remains potent, meanwhile &lt;span style = 'color:#E31837;'&gt;Kansas City's'&lt;/span&gt; has taken a huge dive\", \n    y= \"\", \n    x = \"\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Hurt’s first two years as an NFL starting QB, The Eagles struggled on offense where Kansas City dominated.

In the two years since Super Bowl LVII, The Eagles have remained the seventh best offense in the league where Kansas City has dropped all the way down to 15th.\nNext, Let’s look at Jalen Hurts and his touchdown to interception ratio since he was named the Eagles week one starting Quarterback in 2021.\n\n\nCode\nTopRatios &lt;- QBs |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt;= 2021) |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    TDs = sum(TD),\n    INTs = sum(Int)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TDs)) |&gt; \n  head(20)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=TopRatios,\n    aes(y=reorder(Player, TDs), x=TDs, xend=INTs),\n    colour = \"darkgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\",\n    size = 2.5) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"Hurts' TD/INT isn't even top 10\",\n   subtitle = \"When comparing &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;TDs&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;INTs&lt;/span&gt;, the Eagles QB trails in comparison to the NFL's elite\",\n   caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\" ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(,\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11)\n   \n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly enough, Jalen Hurts doesn’t even crack the top ten of quarterbacks. While Hurts still has a positive TD/INT ratio, he lacks behind many of the NFL’s top quarterbacks and even some who haven’t had sustained succuess since before Hurts was drafted.\nThis makes one question, Just how were the Eagles able to stay dominant on offense?\nLet’s Look at their offensive yardage distribution from this last year and see take a look at how they dominated through out the season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=TopOffenses24Long, aes(x=reorder(Tm, value), weight = value, fill=Type), color=\"grey\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#013369\",\"#D50A0A\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    title=\"Eagles rushing attack proves to be major threat\",\n    subtitle=\"Only the Ravens have more rushing yards\", \n    x= \"\", \n    y = \"Total Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), ,\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is interesting is that, unlike most teams in the NFL, the Eagles dominated in the run game this past year. The only team that out rushed Philadelphia was Baltimore.\nThe one constant throughout the Chiefs dynasty has been to keep the ball out of Mahomes hands. The best way to do that is to rush for first downs. Let’s take a look at how Philadelphia stacked up to the rest of the league with their rushes for first downs and rushing touchdowns scored.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = TotalOffense24,\n    aes(x=RushingFirstDowns, y=RushingYds, size=RushingTD), alpha =0.3) +\n  scale_size(range=c(3,8), name = \"Rushing TDs\"\n  ) +\n \n  geom_point(\n    data=Eagles24,\n    aes(x=RushingFirstDowns, y=RushingYds, size=RushingTD),\n    color = \"#4CBB17\") +\n    geom_text_repel(\n    data = Eagles24,\n    aes(x=RushingFirstDowns, y=RushingYds, label = Tm))+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 115.0625) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 2036.688) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Rushing First Downs\", y = \"Total Rushing Yards\",\n    title = \"The Eagles rushing attack is a game changer\",\n    subtitle = \"Opposing teams can't get them off the field\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 115.0625, y = 3200),\n    label = \"A Team's Rushing Total\",\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"#d50a0a\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 150, y = 2100),\n    label = \"Teams First Downs from Rush \",\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"#d50a0a\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 130, y = 2800),\n    label = \"More yards, more first downs\",\n    size = 3, \n    color = \"#013369\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = 100, y = 1400),\n    label = \"Less yards, less first downs\",\n    size = 3, \n    color = \"#013369\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a surprise to no-one, the Eagles dominated in the run game. A lot of it can be attributed to two key factors this past season. The addition of Saquon Barkley to the Eagles running back room and they’re secret weapon, the tush push.\nWhat does this mean? It means that the Eagles are able to stay on the field longer and drain more clock, Not giving Mahomes or the Chiefs offense an opportunity to see the ball.\nOne may look at this and see that the Eagles may seem unstoppable, with a deadly running attack and above average quarterback play, there should be no way that the Eagles don’t over take Kansas City as a dynasty.\nHowever historically, there has been an achilles heel when it comes to the Eagles year to year.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=TeamDefense, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm)) +\n geom_point(data=TeamDefense, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm), size = 5) +\n  geom_text(data = TeamDefense |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x = Season - .2, y=Rk, label = Tm), size = 3.5, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = TeamDefense |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x = Season + .2, y=Rk, label = Tm), size = 3.5, hjust = 0) +\n   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024), limits = c(2018, 2026)) + \n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c( \n  \"Kansas City Chiefs\" = \"#E31837\",\n  \"Philadelphia Eagles\" = \"#4CBB17\",\n  \"other\" = \"grey\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  labs(title=\"Philly's defense remains one of the most inconsistent in the NFL\", \n       subtitle=\"Compared to the &lt;span style = 'color:#E31837;'&gt;Chiefs'&lt;/span&gt;, The &lt;span style = 'color:#4CBB17;'&gt;Eagles'&lt;/span&gt; stuggle to stay among the leagues best Defenses\", \n       y= \"\",\n       x = \"Season\",\n       caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Nolan Benbow\") +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eagles have not been able to field a consistent defense from year to year. When looking back since the 2020 season, Philadelphia’s defense has been one of the most inconsistent in the league. While part of it could be due to a change in coordinator in 2023, the fall from the defense in 2023 is even worse than that of the Kansas City Chiefs offense that same season.\nHowever, If the Eagles defense can find consistency, and assuming the team stays healthy, The Eagles have a real great shot at dethroning the Mahomes and Chiefs dynasty."
